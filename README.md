## Pipeline_Ablation

Training an AI model need codes to process data, build a model, and specify the training and testing process.
The entire code in which these codes work organically can be called a **pipeline**. 
This repo covers pytorch implementation of three pipelines and compares each code style. 
All pipelines deals the same model, data, and task. Each pipeline is my own pipeline, huggingface, and pytorchlightning.
