## Pipeline_Ablation

Deep learning modeling requires a series of processes for data, model, and training.
A huge piece of code that includes all of these processes and works organically can be called a **pipeline**.
Implementing a pipeline from scratch is difficult, so there are various libraries that help with this.
This repo implements representativefour libraries and compare them with each other.
